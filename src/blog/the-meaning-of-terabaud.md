# The meaning of `terabaud`

`terabaud` stands for `10^12 baud`. A baud is a unit for data transmission bandwidth.
I came to this nickname in my youth when I played DOS games with my brother over a serial network connection.
A usual connection speed for null modem cable was 9600 baud. It took ages to transmit data from one computer
to another and I basically wanted more speed so I prefixed `baud` with `tera`.

I decided to keep my nickname for now :)
